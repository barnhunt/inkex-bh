The area that the elements are distributed to is taken to be the bounding box of all elements with the bh:rat-placement attribute set to "boundary".  (Please not that clipping is not taken into account when computing the bounding box.)

Any elements tag with attribute bh:rat-placement set to "exclude" define areas where rats will not be placed. (This is done on a best-effort basis, and is not guaranteed.)</_param>
